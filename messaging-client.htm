Loved ones initiate conversations with inmates for a specific "mailing rate". They may then choose to provide "return postage" so that inmates may reply. Loved ones may send text and images, while inmates may only respond with text. Many restrictions are placed on this client due to security concerns. This repository contains the code for the two separate components of this messaging client - a kiosk version intended for use by inmates and a responsive version used by those communicating with said inmates.</p>

                        <h3>Messaging Client Overview</h3>
                        <p>This messaging client consists of three parts – which required design and development. It consists of a restricted kiosk application for use by inmates, a responsive webpage to support a broad array of devices, and dedicated mobile applications. The intended goal of this client was to provide inmates with the ability to communicate with their loved ones in near-real time. The client borrows many words from the world of postal mail. Stamps indicate available credits. These credits are sold by each facility and purchased by the inmates loved ones. Currently, a message may only be initiated by a loved one. They may send text and images to the inmate. If they so choose, they may provide “return postage” for the inmate to draft a text-only reply. The client’s limited functionality is related to the security measures required to ensure no illegal communications occur.</p>

                        <h3>My Process</h3>
                        <p>Prior to the implementation of this messaging application, a variant was already in existence. Our organization acquired the business and set about stripping the application down to the backend code and building it back up to suit our needs. My design process began by studying and understanding the current application. Additionally, I was able to learn from the previous owners what things could have been done differently and what improvement opportunities existed. From this, I materialized a set of users flows for both user personas.
                            <br><img src="/images/messaging-client/ff-user-flow.png" id="image_2">
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <img src="/images/messaging-client/inmate-user-flow.png" id="image_3">
                            <br>
                            <br>From there, I met with our business analysts and product owners to understand their project goals and to discuss how we might go about implementing them. Once I had a strong understanding of our organization’s goals, I set about materializing user flow diagrams and initial wireframes, keeping in mind our user personas, the goals identified by the organization, and the improvement opportunities identified by the previous owners.
                            <br>Once the initial wireframes had been completed, I again met with our product owner, business analysts, and backend architects to review initial screens and ensure they not only met the business goals, but were also technically feasible based on the current backend framework. Several improvement opportunities were identified around the checkout process and the use of stamps. These improvement opportunities were then wrapped up into an initial set of mockups – stylized wireframes adhering to brand style guides and finalizing content placement and styling. Again, all teams involved in the process met to discuss the flow, the incorporation of all business goals, and the backend feasibility.
                            <br>
                            <img src="/images/messaging-client/isometric-wireframes.png" id="image_4">
                            <br>
                            <br>After finalizing the mockups, I progressed to generating frontend code. To begin, I mocked up all backend services and created simulated API calls so that I could test functionality prior to backend services being available. I focused first on the kiosk application which inmates use to interact with the product. This application is created as one of many modules which are display on a kiosk terminal within prison. Inmates have access to these kiosks at certain hours throughout the day and may use the provided services. Once completed, I moved to development of the responsive web application. This application serves the friends and family members of the incarcerated individual. This application required much more development time as users have much more functionality including purchasing stamps and their actual composition capabilities. Backend developers are then left to remove mocked API calls and replace with correct services.
                            <br>Throughout my entire design and development process I not only met with our product owner and business analysts but I also reviewed my progress at a weekly meeting with those individuals within our organization involved in UX and UI. Any feedback was incorporated into the final designs, where applicable.</p>
